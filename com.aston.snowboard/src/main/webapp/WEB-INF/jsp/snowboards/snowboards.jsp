        <p><br>A rocker board is in a shape of a smiley face when looked at from the side. It is a great board to use
            on smaller runs. There is more turning control at slower speeds. A rocker board is also great for
            the jib park. If you are looking for a good pop this may not be the style for you. While you can use
            a rocker type board in deeper snow it may be a bit more challenging.</p>

        <p><br>A camber snowboard is in a shape of a frowny face when looked at from the side. It is a great bard to use
            on all types of runs. A camber board will pop out of deeper snow well. They will give a better pop for larger
            jumps. They are great for  turning at higher speeds. A camber board is more difficult to manuver at slower
            speeds. They are a bit more difficult to manage the jib park as well.</p>

        <p><br>A rocker/camber combo board is a combination of both rocker and camber boards. A rocker/camber board is in
            a shape of a nervous face when looked at from the side. They are great all mountain boards that offer a taste
            of both rocker and camber boards. A rocker/camber board offers the control at slower speeds that a rocker board
            offers. They have some pop to them when taking jumps. They are a difficult to manage for beginners because
            they respond differently depending the speed.</p>
